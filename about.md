title: About

I am Jader computer scientist from University of Brasilia currently doing a MSc
degree at Unicamp. For my BSc thesis I studied meta-learning applied to
algorithm selection in a concept change context.

I have interests in the limits of computational learning, some theories that I
am currently studying is meta-learning, algorithmic probability, kolmogorov
complexity, and pac-learning. I've worked with many areas in machine learning,
like computer vision, NLP, time-series, etc.
