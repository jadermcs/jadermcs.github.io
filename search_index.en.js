Making a product available at the market below the market price does not give you good returns, but also a very high value does not appeal to buyers, regressive models in this case are of great help in making the decision about the pricing of an input. The predictive performance of composite models compared to simple models has been remarkable in many areas 1, simple models are those that use pure machine learning algorithms, whereas composite models combine the predictions of two or more algorithms in an attempt to improve the prediction. In this post I will try to present efficient ways to combine models to minimize the error of Boston's square-meter property price predictions.\nPreparing the Data\nHere I will use a famous house price dataset, but the technique discussed here can be extended to pricing almost anything. First I will import and load my dataset into the “boston” variable using Pandas, the Python module famous for its data analysis focused on finance.

First let's see how the distribution we want to predict next to the \"normalized\" distribution by \\(log (x + 1)\\), (adding one to the value avoids us having problems with zeros).\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nsns.set(style=\"whitegrid\", palette=\"coolwarm\")\n\ndf.plot.box(figsize=(10,3), patch_artist=True);\n\n\nFirst I load the chart libraries that I will use throughout the text, set the style and color palette for the chart, then set up a prices dataframe to receive two columns of values, one with the price without transformation, the other with the transformed price by log1p (\\(log(x + 1)\\)) function.\nprices = pd.DataFrame({\"Price\":df[\"MEDV\"], \"log(Price + 1)\":np.log1p(df[\"MEDV\"])})\n\nprices.hist(color=\"#F1684E\", bins=50, figsize=(10,3))\nplt.ylabel(\"Amount\");\n\n\nWe can see that our distribution has been less spaced and a little closer to a normal distribution, but Python has a statistical function that helps us evaluate whether this will be necessary or not, through the Box-Cox test that will have clues with the degree of skewness.\nfrom scipy.stats import skew\n\nfor col in df.keys():\n    sk = skew(df[col])\n    if sk &gt; 0.75:\n        print(col, sk)\n\nCRIM 5.207652387859715\nZN 2.219063057148425\nCHAS 3.395799292642519\nDIS 1.0087787565152246\nRAD 1.0018334924536951\nLSTAT 0.9037707431346133\nMEDV 1.104810822864635\n\nUm Pouco de Feature Engeneering\nO teste de Box-Cox2 nos diz que um skew acima de 0.75 pode ser linearizado pela função log(x+1), fazendo a distribuição ficar mais normalizada, abaixo disso posso manter o valor como estava sem necessidades de modificação, vamos olhar o antes e depois de aplicar essa função a nossas distribuições. (Suprimi algumas variáveis para não poluir demais o gráfico).\ndfnorm = (df - df.mean()) / (df.std())\nfor x in [\"CRIM\", \"ZN\", \"CHAS\",\"MEDV\"]:\n    sns.kdeplot(dfnorm[x])\nplt.title(\"Distrution Mean Value\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Price\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Amount\");\n\n\nfor col in df.keys():\n    sk = skew(df[col])\n    if sk &gt; 0.75:\n        df[col] = np.log1p(df[col])\n\ndfnorm = (df - df.mean()) / (df.std())\nfor x in [\"CRIM\", \"ZN\", \"CHAS\",\"MEDV\"]:\n    sns.kdeplot(dfnorm[x])\nplt.title(\"Distribution Mean Value\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Price\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Amount\");\n\n\nVemos que as distribuições ficaram muito mais centradas e tendendo a distribuição gaussiana3, o que será excelente para o ajuste dos nossos estimadores4. Sendo a função logarítmica e a função \\(f.x+1\\) bijetoras, poderemos retornar ao nosso valor original assim que acabarmos o ajuste do modelo.\nSimplificando nossos dados\nNossos dados ainda podem estar muito complexos, a escala em que se encontram e talvez um excesso de informação necessária podem impossibilitar que nosso modelo atinja a perfeição. Aqui iremos aplicar duas técnicas, a primeira e escalonamento de variáveis pelo máximo-mínimo, transformação que também é reversível é poderá ser desfeita ao preço final, bastando eu guardar as variáveis da minha transformação.\ndf.std()\n\nCRIM         1.022731\nZN           1.620831\nINDUS        6.860353\nCHAS         0.176055\nNOX          0.115878\nRM           0.702617\nAGE         28.148861\nDIS          0.413390\nRAD          0.751839\nTAX        168.537116\nPTRATIO      2.164946\nB           91.294864\nLSTAT        0.539033\nMEDV         0.386966\ndtype: float64\n\nIt is visible that some variables are extremely dispersed, we can change this with the following formula:\n$$ z_i=\\frac{x_i-\\min(x)}{\\max(x)-\\min(x)} $$\nThus our variables will be between zero and one, making the prediction simpler.\ndfmin, dfmax = df.min(), df.max()\ndf = (df - df.min())/(df.max()-df.min())\ndf.std()\n\nCRIM       0.227615\nZN         0.351200\nINDUS      0.251479\nCHAS       0.253994\nNOX        0.238431\nRM         0.134627\nAGE        0.289896\nDIS        0.227300\nRAD        0.297672\nTAX        0.321636\nPTRATIO    0.230313\nB          0.230205\nLSTAT      0.202759\nMEDV       0.180819\ndtype: float64\n\nGreat!!\nAll ready\nFinished our data tuning after so much work we are now going to adjust our models, get used to it, handling the data is what will consume you most time in a machine learning process. But finally let's take a final look at how they got distributed. I will use the internal function of Pandas, boxplot, if you have any doubt what this chart represents, see here.\ndf.plot.box(figsize=(10,3), patch_artist=True);\n\n\nAs already discussed in other posts, we should separate the data into a training and testing set, to train our model and to know how well our model will predict for unknown cases. Read this article for a better understanding.\nHere we use Scikit-Learn's built-in function to separate data, for additional information on all of the function variables below I suggest consulting the official documentation. As the first argument I pass my X, attributes, and the second argument my y, the value I want to predict, finally I pass an integer to make my results reproducible by making the random processes of functions nonrandom.\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nxtrain, xtest, ytrain, ytest =\\\n    train_test_split(df.drop('MEDV',1).values, df['MEDV'].values, random_state=201)\n\nNow we will import our two models, the first one being XGBoost, an algorithm that has been proving extremely efficient in competitions and the famous Ridge regression algorithm. We will evaluate our models by square mean error.\nfrom lightgbm import LGBMRegressor\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import Ridge\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n\nHere I perform a slight improvement on the hyperparameters with GridSearchCV to look for the combination of the hyperparameters that will give me a better prediction, then I adjust my model to the data and having it train, I predict data it doesn't know, then evaluate the model performance as said.\nparams = {'alpha': np.linspace(0.1,1,200),\n          'random_state':[2020]}\n\nmodel1 = GridSearchCV(estimator = Ridge(), param_grid = params, cv=5)\nmodel1.fit(xtrain,ytrain)\nlinpred = model1.predict(xtest)\n\nerr1 = mean_squared_error(linpred, ytest)\nprint(err1)\n\n0.00745856883004946\n\nparams = {'reg_alpha': np.linspace(0,1,10),\n          'gamma': np.linspace(0,1,1),\n          'reg_lambda': np.linspace(0,1,1)}\n\nmodel2 = GridSearchCV(estimator = LGBMRegressor(), param_grid = params, cv=5)\nmodel2.fit(xtrain, ytrain)\nlgbmpred = model2.predict(xtest)\n\nerr2 = mean_squared_error(lgbmpred, ytest)\nprint(err2)\n\n0.005040440132637956\n\nVery good results, but can we make them even better?! Let's look at whether our predictions have a low correlation.\npredictions = pd.DataFrame({\"LightGBM\":np.expm1(lgbmpred), \"Ridge\":np.expm1(linpred)})\npredictions.plot(x = \"LightGBM\", y = \"Ridge\", kind = \"scatter\", color=\"#85C8DD\");\n\n\nAs already explained, a low correlation tends to significantly improve our prediction, visually we have something significant, let's look at that now in numbers.\nfrom scipy import stats\n_, _, r_value, _, std_err = stats.linregress(np.expm1(lgbmpred),np.expm1(linpred))\nprint(r_value, std_err)\n\n0.9193021766109413 0.03313351573076193\n\nBecause our r-value is not too high (&lt;.95), we can benefit from the combination of estimates. We get to the initial motivation part of combining models to increase predictive performance. I will test 3 combinations of predictions, weighted mean, simple mean, and harmonic mean.\nerr3 = mean_squared_error(lgbmpred * 0.8 + linpred * 0.2, ytest) # weighted mean\nerr4 = mean_squared_error((lgbmpred + linpred)/2, ytest) # mean\nerr5 = mean_squared_error(stats.hmean([lgbmpred, linpred]), ytest) # harmonic mean\nprint(err3, err4, err5)\n\n0.004830881999425605 0.005166404680258313 0.004927370731820139\n\nExcelente, ouve uma melhora significativa, mas o quão significativa?\n1-err3/err2\n\n0.041575363995579706\n\nThat's right, a 4% improvement from our best estimator, quite significant for something so simple, and such improvements over high performance algorithms are of utmost importance in the data science world, perhaps even help us jump thousands of positions towards top in a competition worth $ 1.2 million 5.\nConcluding\nThe main purpose of this publication was to demonstrate that a simple combination of two models can significantly impact their prediction, but during this process I did some data treatment that will impress you on the impact of reducing our error, try evaluating the models without performing some of the treatments I gave to the data ... In future publications, more will be explained about each technique seen here.\nReferences\n1\nPolikar, R. (2006). \"Ensemble based systems in decision making\".

I am watching the lectures from this\nlink.\nAlso reading two books, Principles of Economics, by Mankiw, and Basic Economics, by Sowell.\nIntroduction\n\nComparative Advantage: Refers to the ability of an individual, firm, or country to produce a good or service at a lower opportunity cost than another individual, firm, or country. Opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative that must be given up in order to engage in a certain activity. The concept of comparative advantage is central to international trade theory and suggests that countries or individuals should specialize in the production of goods and services for which they have a comparative advantage and trade with others for goods and services for which they have a comparative disadvantage.\n\nBy doing so, all parties can benefit from increased efficiency and higher standards of living. The theory of comparative advantage is based on the idea that trade can increase the overall welfare of both countries or individuals, even if one country has an absolute advantage in producing all goods.\n\nTemporal Preferences: Refer to an individual's preference for consuming goods or services now versus in the future. Temporal preferences can be thought of as a trade-off between immediate and delayed satisfaction, as individuals who prefer immediate satisfaction may be willing to consume goods or services now at the expense of sacrificing satisfaction in the future, while individuals who prefer future satisfaction may be willing to delay consumption in order to increase their future satisfaction.\n\nTemporal preferences play an important role in various aspects of economic behavior, including saving and investment decisions, borrowing and lending decisions, and the consumption of goods and services over time.\nEconomic models often assume that individuals have inter temporal preferences that are consistent and stable over time, and that individuals make decisions that maximize their expected utility over time. However, in practice, temporal preferences can vary based on a variety of factors, such as income, age, and risk tolerance, and may change over time as individuals' circumstances and preferences change.\nUnderstanding temporal preferences is important for policymakers and economists as they can impact a wide range of economic outcomes, such as consumption patterns, savings and investment decisions, and the overall functioning of the economy. Thus, it is important to consider temporal preferences when designing and evaluating economic policies, such as those related to savings and retirement, debt management, and consumption taxes.\n\nRisk: Refers to the uncertainty associated with future outcomes. In the context of economics, risk refers to the uncertainty surrounding economic decisions, such as investment, consumption, and production.\n\nRisk can impact economic behavior in many ways, as individuals and firms must take into account the likelihood of different outcomes when making decisions. For example, in the case of investment decisions, individuals and firms must consider the risk of losing money, and must weigh this against the potential reward of higher returns.\n\nUtility: Refers to the satisfaction or happiness that an individual derives from consuming goods or services. Utility is a subjective concept that cannot be measured directly, but is instead inferred from observed behavior and preferences.\n\nEconomic models often assume that individuals make decisions that maximize their utility, meaning they choose to consume goods or services that they expect will provide the greatest level of satisfaction. The total utility that an individual derives from consuming a good or service is influenced by a variety of factors, such as the individual's tastes and preferences, the price of the good or service, and the availability of other goods or services.\nUtility is a key concept in microeconomics, as it is used to explain consumer behavior and to analyze market outcomes. For example, the law of diminishing marginal utility states that as an individual consumes more of a good or service, the additional satisfaction that they derive from each additional unit decreases. This concept is used to explain the downward-sloping demand curve for goods and services.\nOverall, the concept of utility is central to economic analysis, as it provides a framework for understanding how individuals make decisions about what to consume and how much to consume, and how these decisions affect market outcomes and the overall functioning of the economy.\nSupply, Demand, and Equilibrium\n\nSupply: Refers to the quantity of a good or service that a producer is willing and able to offer for sale at a given price in a given time period. In economics, supply is a function of price and other factors that affect the production of the good or service, such as technology, resource availability, and government policies.\n\nAn increase in the price of a good or service will typically lead to an increase in supply, as producers will be incentivized to produce more in order to earn higher profits. Conversely, a decrease in the price of a good or service will typically lead to a decrease in supply, as producers will be less motivated to produce at lower prices. The relationship between price and supply is usually represented graphically as a supply curve, which slopes upward to the right, indicating that higher prices lead to higher levels of supply.\n\nDemand: Refers to the quantity of a good or service that a consumer is willing and able to purchase at a given price in a given time period. In economics, demand is a function of price, income, preferences, and other factors that affect the consumer's willingness and ability to purchase the good or service.\n\nAn increase in the price of a good or service will typically lead to a decrease in demand, as consumers will be less willing to pay the higher price. Conversely, a decrease in the price of a good or service will typically lead to an increase in demand, as consumers will be more willing to purchase the good or service at the lower price. The relationship between price and demand is usually represented graphically as a demand curve, which slopes downward to the right, indicating that higher prices lead to lower levels of demand. The intersection of the supply and demand curves determines the market price and the quantity of the good or service that will be produced and consumed.\n\nMarket Equilibrium: Refers to a state where the supply of a good or service is equal to the demand for that good or service. In other words, the market is in balance, and there is no excess supply or excess demand. At this point, the market price has reached a level where the quantity of the good or service that producers are willing to supply is equal to the quantity that consumers are willing to purchase.\n\nEquilibrium is a dynamic concept and can change in response to changes in the factors that affect supply and demand, such as price, income, preferences, technology, and government policies. The market will continue to adjust until a new equilibrium is reached. Equilibrium can be represented graphically as the point where the supply and demand curves intersect. The market price at this point is called the market-clearing price, and the quantity of the good or service produced and consumed is called the market-clearing quantity.\n\nElasticity: Refers to the responsiveness of demand or supply to changes in price or other factors that affect the market. The concept of elasticity is used to measure the degree to which changes in price (or other factors) result in changes in the quantity demanded (or supplied) of a good or service. There are several different types of elasticity, including price elasticity of demand, price elasticity of supply, income elasticity of demand, and cross-price elasticity of demand.\n\nPrice elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a good or service to changes in its price. A good or service is considered to be price elastic if a small change in price leads to a relatively large change in the quantity demanded. If a good or service is price inelastic, a small change in price leads to a relatively small change in the quantity demanded.\nPrice elasticity of supply measures the responsiveness of the quantity supplied of a good or service to changes in its price. A good or service is considered to be price elastic if a small change in price leads to a relatively large change in the quantity supplied. If a good or service is price inelastic, a small change in price leads to a relatively small change in the quantity supplied.\nTaxes and Subsidies\n\nCommodity taxes: also known as excise taxes, are taxes imposed on specific goods or services. They are often used by governments to raise revenue, as well as to discourage the consumption of certain goods or services deemed to be harmful to society, such as tobacco or alcohol. Commodity taxes are different from sales taxes, which are levied on all goods and services purchased, and income taxes, which are levied on individuals and businesses based on their income.\n\nCommodity taxes can impact the price of the taxed good or service, as the tax is typically passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. This can result in changes in demand for the taxed good or service, as consumers may choose to reduce their consumption or switch to substitute goods or services that are not taxed.\nCommodity taxes can also impact the behavior of producers, as they may adjust their production processes or choose to shift production to another location to avoid the tax.\nOverall, commodity taxes can play an important role in shaping the economy, as they can influence the behavior of both consumers and producers. It is important for governments to carefully consider the impact of commodity taxes on the economy, as well as their impact on the welfare of individuals and society as a whole, when designing and implementing tax policies.\n\nSubsidy: is a payment or other support provided by a government to an individual, company, or sector in order to support a specific activity, product, or service. The goal of subsidies is to encourage the production and consumption of goods and services deemed to be of value to society, or to support the development of certain industries or regions.\n\nSubsidies can take many forms, including direct payments, tax breaks, low-interest loans, or the provision of goods or services at below-market prices. They are often used to address market failures, such as externalities, or to support industries or regions that are seen as struggling.\nHowever, subsidies can also lead to unintended consequences, such as creating a distorted market and encouraging inefficiency, reducing the competitiveness of unsubsidised firms, or leading to the overproduction of goods or services that may not be in demand.\nIt is important for governments to carefully consider the impact of subsidies, as well as alternative policy options, when designing and implementing economic policies. This can involve evaluating the costs and benefits of subsidies, considering their impact on the economy and society as a whole, and ensuring that subsidies are well-targeted and transparent, in order to maximize their effectiveness and minimize any potential negative effects.\nThe Price System\n\nInvisible Hand: is a term used by Adam Smith to describe the unintended beneficial consequences of individuals pursuing their own self-interest in a market economy. Smith, widely considered the father of modern economics, believed that the pursuit of self-interest by individuals in the market would lead to an efficient allocation of resources, even without the intervention of the government or any other central authority.\n\nSmith argued that in a market economy, individuals who are motivated by their own self-interest will make decisions about production and consumption that are best for society as a whole. For example, a manufacturer who wants to maximize profits will produce goods that are in high demand, and consumers who want to maximize their own satisfaction will buy goods that are of high quality and low price. According to Smith, these mutually beneficial transactions between buyers and sellers result in an efficient allocation of resources and a general increase in prosperity for society as a whole.\nThe concept of the invisible hand is often used to describe the power of the market to coordinate the actions of millions of individuals and to produce outcomes that are in the best interest of society as a whole. However, it is important to note that the invisible hand is not a guarantee of a perfectly efficient market or a perfectly just society. There are many cases in which market failures can occur, such as when there are externalities or when information is asymmetrical, and in these cases, government intervention may be necessary to correct market inefficiencies. Despite this, the invisible hand remains an important concept in economics, and it continues to be used to describe the power of the market to allocate resources in a way that is beneficial for society.\n\nSignal: in economics is any information that is used by individuals or firms to make decisions. Signals can take many forms, including prices, wages, and advertising. For example, the price of a good is a signal that provides information about its scarcity and the level of demand for it. By observing the price of a good, individuals can make decisions about whether to buy or sell it.\n\n\nIncentives: are rewards or punishments that are used to influence the behavior of individuals and firms. Incentives can take many forms, including profits, losses, bonuses, and taxes. For example, the profit motive is an incentive that encourages individuals and firms to produce goods and services that are in high demand. By observing the potential for profit, individuals and firms are motivated to produce goods and services that are of high quality and low price.\n\nSignals and incentives are critical components of a market economy, and they play a central role in determining the allocation of resources and the distribution of goods and services. By providing information about the relative scarcity of goods and services, signals help to coordinate the actions of buyers and sellers, and by providing rewards and punishments, incentives help to motivate individuals and firms to make decisions that are in the best interest of society as a whole. Together, signals and incentives help to ensure that the market operates efficiently and effectively, producing outcomes that are in the best interest of society.\nPrice Ceilings and Price Floors\n\nShortages: Refers to a situation where the demand for a good or service exceeds the available supply. This results in some buyers not being able to purchase the quantity they would like to at the current market price. In such a scenario, the price of the good or service is likely to increase as a result of competition among buyers for the limited available supply.\n\nThe extent of the shortage, and the resulting price increase, will depend on the size of the supply shortfall and the elasticity of demand for the good or service.\n\nMisallocation of Resources: Refers to the allocation of economic resources (such as labor, capital, and land) to uses that are less efficient or less valuable than alternative uses. This can occur due to market failures, government intervention, or other factors that cause prices to deviate from their true market-clearing levels.\n\nAs a result of misallocation, some firms may produce goods or services that are less in demand, while other firms may be unable to produce the goods or services that consumers want. This leads to a suboptimal allocation of resources and a reduction in overall economic efficiency and welfare.\n\nDeadweight Loss: Refers to the reduction in economic welfare or surplus that results from market inefficiencies. It is the value of the goods and services that could have been produced or consumed but are not because of market failures such as monopolies, price controls, taxes, or other factors that prevent prices from reaching their market-clearing levels.\n\nDeadweight loss is a measure of the efficiency loss to society from these market failures and can be represented graphically as the area between the supply and demand curves and the market price. The larger the deadweight loss, the greater the inefficiency in the market and the lower the overall level of economic welfare.\n\nQuality Reduction: Refers to a decrease in the quality of a good or service due to market factors or production decisions. In some cases, firms may choose to lower the quality of their products in order to lower costs and increase profits. For example, a manufacturer may use lower-quality materials or reduce the number of features on a product in order to lower its price.\n\nQuality reduction can also occur as a result of competition in the market, as firms try to undercut each other on price. This can lead to a reduction in the overall quality of goods and services available to consumers. The result is a reduction in consumer surplus, as buyers are not able to purchase the high-quality goods they would prefer at the current market price.\n\nSearch Costs: Refer to the costs associated with finding information about goods or services that a consumer is interested in purchasing. These costs can include the time and effort required to find information about the product, the cost of physically searching for the product, and the cost of evaluating the quality of the product.\n\nHigh search costs can reduce the number of transactions that occur in a market and can prevent consumers from finding the best deal or the best-quality product. This can lead to a reduction in consumer surplus and a less efficient allocation of resources in the market. In some cases, high search costs can also create barriers to entry for new firms, leading to reduced competition and higher prices for consumers.\nTrade\n\nTariffs and Protectionism: Refer to government policies aimed at restricting imports and promoting domestic production. A tariff is a tax on imported goods that raises the price of imported goods relative to domestically produced goods. The goal of tariffs is to make imported goods less competitive with domestic goods, thus increasing demand for domestic goods and protecting domestic producers.\n\nProtectionism is a broader term that encompasses a range of policies aimed at promoting domestic production and protecting domestic producers from foreign competition. In addition to tariffs, protectionist policies can include quotas, subsidies, and other measures designed to limit imports and promote domestic production.\nProtectionist policies are often motivated by the desire to protect domestic jobs and industries, as well as to maintain control over key industries. However, protectionist policies can also have negative consequences, such as reducing economic efficiency, limiting consumer choice, and increasing the cost of goods for consumers.\nIn addition, protectionist policies can lead to retaliation from other countries, as they may respond by imposing their own tariffs and other restrictions on imports from the protecting country. This can result in trade wars, in which countries engage in a series of tit-for-tat measures aimed at protecting their own producers and limiting imports from other countries.\nOverall, tariffs and protectionism are controversial economic policies that are often used by governments to promote domestic production and protect domestic producers. While they can provide short-term benefits to domestic producers, they can also have negative consequences for the economy and for consumers, and can lead to trade conflicts, lower product quality, and other economic disruptions.\nExternalities\n\nExternalities: are costs or benefits associated with a market activity that are not reflected in the market price. In other words, externalities are effects of a market activity that are experienced by third parties who are not directly involved in the transaction.\n\nExternalities can be positive or negative. Positive externalities occur when a market activity generates benefits for third parties, such as when a factory creates jobs in the local community. Negative externalities occur when a market activity generates costs for third parties, such as when a factory pollutes the air and water.\nThe presence of externalities can result in market inefficiencies, as the market price does not reflect the full cost or benefit of a market activity. For example, if a factory is generating negative externalities in the form of pollution, the market price for the goods produced by the factory will be lower than the true cost of the pollution. This can result in too much of the activity being produced from the perspective of society as a whole.\nTo address externalities, governments may intervene in the market through regulation, taxes, subsidies, or other measures. The goal of these policies is to internalize the externality, meaning to make the cost or benefit of the market activity part of the market price.\nOverall, externalities are an important concept in economics, as they demonstrate how market activities can generate costs or benefits for society as a whole, and how government intervention may be necessary to address these effects and ensure that markets function efficiently.\nCosts and Profit Maximization Under Profit\nCompetition and the Invisible Hand\nMonopoly\nPrice Discrimination\n\nPrice Discrimination: Refers to the practice of charging different prices to different customers for the same good or service. This can occur when a seller is able to distinguish between different market segments and charge different prices based on the willingness of each segment to pay.\n\nThere are several forms of price discrimination, including first-degree price discrimination, second-degree price discrimination, and third-degree price discrimination.\nFirst-degree price discrimination, also known as perfect price discrimination, occurs when a seller is able to charge each customer the maximum price that they are willing to pay for a good or service. This type of price discrimination requires the seller to have complete information about the willingness to pay of each customer, which is usually not possible in real-world market situations.\nSecond-degree price discrimination occurs when a seller charges different prices based on the quantity of the good or service that is purchased. For example, a seller may offer discounts for bulk purchases.\nThird-degree price discrimination occurs when a seller charges different prices based on demographic characteristics, such as age or income. For example, a movie theater may charge a lower ticket price for senior citizens or students.\nPrice discrimination can have both benefits and drawbacks. On the one hand, it allows firms to capture additional revenue from customers who are willing to pay more, which can increase profits. On the other hand, price discrimination can create market inefficiencies and lead to unfair treatment of customers who are charged a higher price for the same good or service. Additionally, price discrimination can lead to a reduction in consumer surplus, as consumers who are charged a higher price for a good or service are worse off than they would be if the price were the same for everyone.\nPrice discrimination is a controversial topic, and the practice is subject to regulation in many countries to ensure that it does not harm consumers or result in market inefficiencies.\n\nTying: is a business practice in which a firm requires a customer to purchase one product as a condition for purchasing a different product. For example, a software company may require customers to purchase a computer operating system in order to purchase a productivity software package.\n\nTying can create a number of economic and competition issues. For example, tying can limit competition in the market for the tied product, as customers may feel forced to purchase the tied product even if they would prefer a different product. This can result in higher prices and reduced quality for the tied product.\nAdditionally, tying can limit the ability of customers to choose the products that best meet their needs, as they are forced to purchase products in a bundle. This can result in a reduction in consumer surplus, as customers are worse off than they would be if they were able to purchase the products they want separately.\nIn many countries, tying is subject to regulation to ensure that it does not harm competition or result in market inefficiencies. For example, in the United States, tying arrangements are subject to scrutiny under the antitrust laws, and may be illegal if they result in harm to competition.\nTying can also be used in certain circumstances to promote efficiency or to support complementary products. For example, a software company may require customers to purchase a computer operating system in order to purchase a productivity software package because the software package is designed to work best with the operating system. In such cases, tying can benefit both the seller and the customer by promoting efficiency and improving the quality of the products.\n\nBundling: Refers to the practice of selling two or more products together as a single combined package. This can be seen in many different industries, including software, consumer goods, and entertainment.\n\nBundling can provide several benefits to both firms and consumers. For example, bundling can reduce the costs of production and distribution for firms, as they are able to sell multiple products in a single transaction. This can result in lower prices for consumers, who benefit from the economies of scale.\nAdditionally, bundling can help firms to cross-sell complementary products, as customers are more likely to purchase additional products when they are sold as part of a bundle. For example, a software company may offer a bundle that includes a computer operating system and several productivity software packages, in order to encourage customers to purchase the software packages along with the operating system.\nBundling can also create certain challenges, as it can limit competition in the market for the bundled products. For example, if a firm offers a bundle that includes a computer operating system and several productivity software packages, this may limit the ability of other software companies to compete in the market for productivity software.\nIn many countries, bundling is subject to regulation to ensure that it does not harm competition or result in market inefficiencies. For example, in the United States, bundling arrangements are subject to scrutiny under the antitrust laws, and may be illegal if they result in harm to competition.\nOverall, bundling can be a useful marketing strategy for firms, as it allows them to offer multiple products to customers at a lower cost, while also promoting the sale of complementary products. However, it is important to carefully consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of bundling in order to ensure that it does not harm competition or result in market inefficiencies.\nLabor Markets\n\nHuman Capital: Refers to the knowledge, skills, and abilities that individuals acquire through education, training, and work experience, which increase their productivity and earning potential.\n\nIn the context of the labor market, human capital is seen as an important factor in determining an individual's value as an employee. For example, a person with a high level of human capital, such as a advanced degree or specialized training, may be more valuable to an employer than an individual with a lower level of human capital, as they are more likely to have the skills and knowledge needed to perform well in a job.\nInvestment in human capital can lead to a range of benefits for individuals, including increased earning potential, improved job security, and greater career mobility. For society as a whole, investment in human capital can lead to economic growth and development, as individuals with high levels of human capital are more productive and contribute more to the economy.\nHowever, investment in human capital can also lead to certain challenges, such as information asymmetry, which can result in unequal access to education and training opportunities. Additionally, investment in human capital can be costly and time-consuming, which may result in barriers to entry for certain individuals, such as those who are unable to afford the costs of education and training.\nOverall, human capital is a critical component of the labor market, and plays a significant role in determining an individual's earning potential and career opportunities. It is important for individuals to invest in their human capital in order to improve their chances of success in the labor market, and for society to invest in human capital to promote economic growth and development.\n\nCompensating Differentials: Refer to differences in wage rates that compensate workers for differences in the non-monetary aspects of their jobs. Non-monetary aspects of a job can include things like working conditions, job security, and the level of stress associated with the job. The idea behind compensating differentials is that workers will accept lower wage rates for jobs that have undesirable non-monetary characteristics if the wage rate is high enough to compensate them for those characteristics.\n\nFor example, workers who have to work in dangerous or unpleasant conditions might demand higher wage rates to compensate them for the risks they face on the job. Conversely, workers who have jobs that are less stressful and more secure might accept lower wage rates because they value those non-monetary aspects of their jobs. The concept of compensating differentials is based on the idea that workers make rational decisions about the trade-offs between wage rates and the non-monetary aspects of their jobs, and that these trade-offs result in wage differentials that reflect the value of those non-monetary aspects.\n\nMarginal Product of Labor: Refers to the additional output produced by one additional unit of labor, holding all other factors of production constant. MPL is used to describe the relationship between the quantity of labor input and the corresponding change in output, and is an important concept in the analysis of production and labor market decisions.\n\nThe MPL is calculated as the change in total output (i.e., the increase in total production) divided by the change in the number of workers. In other words, it measures the amount of additional output produced by the last unit of labor added to the production process. As more and more units of labor are added, the MPL will initially increase, but eventually, it will start to decline as the law of diminishing returns takes effect.\nThe MPL is important for firms because it provides information about the marginal cost of producing additional units of output. If the MPL is high, then adding an additional unit of labor will result in a large increase in output and a relatively low increase in costs, making it more attractive for firms to hire additional workers. On the other hand, if the MPL is low, then adding an additional unit of labor will result in a small increase in output and a relatively high increase in costs, making it less attractive for firms to hire additional workers. The MPL is also important for workers because it provides information about the marginal benefit of working an additional hour, which is represented by the increase in output produced by that additional hour of work.\nOn signaling\nSignaling in the context of the labor market refers to the use of information about an individual's characteristics, such as education or experience, to indicate their quality or value as an employee. This information is often used by employers to screen job applicants, and by employees to demonstrate their skills and abilities to potential employers.\nFor example, a person with a high-quality education, such as a degree from a prestigious university, may signal to potential employers that they are a highly qualified and skilled individual. Similarly, prior work experience may signal to potential employers that an individual has the relevant skills and knowledge to perform well in a particular job.\nSignaling can play an important role in the labor market by helping employers to identify the most qualified and capable individuals for a given job. It can also help employees to demonstrate their skills and abilities to potential employers, which may increase their chances of being hired.\nHowever, signaling can also lead to certain inefficiencies in the labor market. For example, individuals who are unable to obtain a high-quality education or work experience may be disadvantaged in the labor market, even if they have the necessary skills and abilities to perform well in a job. Additionally, the use of signaling can result in information asymmetry between employers and employees, which can lead to inefficiencies in the market.\nOverall, signaling is an important factor in the labor market, and can play a significant role in determining who gets hired and how much they are paid. It is important for both employers and employees to understand the role of signaling in the labor market in order to make informed decisions about their careers and job opportunities.\nPublic Goods and the Tragedy of the Commons\n\nNon excludable\nNon rival\nClub goods\nwithout property rights the tragedy of the commons happens, so we should at least create a pseudo-property to simulate the properties that avoids this to happen.\n\nAsymmetric Information\nConsumer Choice\nGame Theory\n","id":"https://jadermcs.github.io/archive/notes-on-principles-of-economics/","title":"Notes on Principles of Economics"},"https://jadermcs.github.io/archive/optimizing/":{"body":"In this post I take notes on how to optimize python code and also try to define\npossible approaches in this process. This will be a series of posts, where later\nI expect to cover profiling, where we can have a deep diagnosis on how to improve\nour code.\nI will take long time discussing algorithmic complexity so I will just jump to an\nexponential complexity code, and then present many ways on how to optimize it. So\nhere is our exponential complexity program.\n#!/usr/bin/python3\n\ndef fib(a):\n    if a &lt;= 1:\n        return 1\n    return fib(a-1) + fib(a-2)\n\nfor i in [10, 20, 50]:\n    print(fib(i))\n\nThis code call the function fib many times, recomputing the same results. A simple\nsolution is use a dict to keep previous computed data stored.\n#!/usr/bin/python3\n\nnum = {0: 1, 1:1}\n\ndef fib(a):\n    if a not in num:\n        num[a] = fib(a-1) + fib(a-2)\n    return num[a]\n\nfor i in [10, 20, 50]:\n    print(fib(i))\n\nAlso with functools you can cache the results with the cache decorator. So it will\nstore the function calls.\n#!/usr/bin/python3\nfrom functools import cache\n\n@cache\ndef fib(a):\n    if a &lt;= 1:\n        return 1\n    return fib(a-1) + fib(a-2)\n\nfor i in [10, 20, 50]:\n    print(fib(i))\n\nThe only restriction is that the parameters of the function must be hashable and\nit has no side effects. Another possible approch is instead of caching to memory,\ncaching to disk, so the computed data could be reused between different runs.\n#!/usr/bin/python3\nfrom joblib import Memory\n\nlocation = './cachedir'\nmemory = Memory(location, verbose=0)\n\n@memory.cache\ndef fib(a):\n    if a &lt;= 1:\n        return 1\n    return fib(a-1) + fib(a-2)\n\nfor i in [10, 20, 50]:\n    print(fib(i))\n\nCaching names, methods, etc.\n\n\n","id":"https://jadermcs.github.io/archive/optimizing/","title":"Optimization - Caching"},"https://jadermcs.github.io/archive/readings-2023/":{"body":"Okay, so I am reviving this blog to post reviews about my readings\nfor this year. I pretend to focus my readings in economy, philosophy,\nand sci-fi. Let's go.\nEconomy in One Lesson\nby Henry Hazlitt\n\nThis book is still up-to-date with recent problems we face. Henry follows\na supply demand approach in his analysis of many economical issues. It\nspend most of it's pages defending that everything in a economy is an\nasset, and things like money, or wages does not escape from being subject\nto economical forces and its implications. The book claims that minimum wage,\nprice fixing, and other kind of legislation as does not create any more value,\nhas no benefitial outcome for the overall society. I firmly recommend this\nbook for anyone.\nThe Hobbit\nby J.R.R. Tolkien\n\nThis is certanly one of the times that I want to erase my memory so I could\ntruly appreciate something. This book is surely a master piece, but reading\nit already knowing what will happen totally cuts the hype. The book is\nsubstatialy better then the film, there are many psychological and\nenvironmental aspects that lack in the film. It was a pity to have a couldn't\nenjoy as a first experience.\nHuman Compatible\nby Stuart Russell\n\nRussell lives up to its position as director of artificial intelligence in Google,\nthe deep and broad understand in artificial intelligence that he has is insane.\nThe book covers topics like philosophy, economy, psicology, neuroscience, and so on.\nRussell presents many aspects that should be consider when creating an AGI an how it\ncan be \"human compatible\" in the sense that it will help and dont harm humans in any way.\nThis is a very deep problem because deal with ethics, utility, espirituality, and other\nsubjects that we still don't have strong knowledge or final answers.\nRationality\nby Eliezer Yudkowsky\n\nThis books is a collection of articles published in Lesswrong blog, it discusses many subjects\nrelated to racionality in an attempt to teach how to be \"rational\", even the definition of what\nbeing rational extends for long pages in the book. This book got me in many ways because when\nstudying about AI, the subjects addressed are very important so answer\nmany questions in AI.\nFoundation #1\nby Isaac Asimov\n\nI love sci-fi literature, but by far Asimov is the best writer I ever experienced\ntheir books follows a \"compilation of small stories\" in the same universe. I am\nnot sure now why he follows this model, but as I can't binge-read books, it helps\nme not get lost when I return after some weeks. The history is around the psico-history\na super complex field of statistics that just a few mind in the entire galaxy can \nunderstand. By using this science to predict that the empire will fall, Seldon\ncreates a encyclopedia, to save human from \"intellectual dark ages\". The way\nthe plot is executed is surely captivating, a must read for sci-fi fans.\nThe State\nby Franz Oppenheimer\n\nThis book tracks the origins of state, it constantly defends that the historical \norigins of state is fundamentally maint this status of conqueror using tributes\nand suppressing the resistance.\n","id":"https://jadermcs.github.io/archive/readings-2023/","title":"Readings 2023"},"https://jadermcs.github.io/archive/stacking/":{"body":"Introduced by Wolpert in 19921, this generalization technique consists of combining nonlinear estimators to correct their biases to a given training set, adding their capabilities for better prediction2.\n\nIn a previous post I presented the linear combination of estimators, in it we adjusted \\(N\\) models to a \\(D\\) dataset and a priori we defined \\(W\\) weights for them by combining into one summation:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i}M_{i}$$\n$$\\text{given a priori} \\ W = (w_1,w_2,...w_N) \\ \\text{and} \\sum W = 1$$\nWith this the weighted average of the predictions in general will be less biased for certain regions and may generalize more, but this method has two limitations, the weights cannot be changed after verifying the performance (if we would not be acting as a meta-estimator in test data) and is an extremely simple combination, not leveraging the strengths of the \\(M\\) estimators for certain regions.\nWolpert then proposes an alternative to this, what if we make \\(W\\) pesos a learning problem? or rather, not only learn how to combine our predictions but also combine them nonlinearly using a meta estimator?\nMeta estimators are those who use base models to combine them or select them to improve on a performance metric, for example you reader when deciding between using a random forest or a logistic regression to predict your model you are being a meta estimator. But here the problem of generalization arises, if you continue to improve your regression or rforest you may end up overfitting the data and not being able to generalize, here then it is necessary to apply cross validation techniques to select the model, the same will happen for the stacking.\nFor stacking it is ideal that the dataset is relatively large, the author's advice is at least one thousand records. We start our example by loading a relatively large dataset, 20,000 records, this dataset has as characteristic attributes of california houses and as a target value its price, the data is already normalized and we will not make any changes to it.\nfrom sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndataset = fetch_california_housing()\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data=dataset.data, columns=dataset.feature_names)\ndf['Price'] = dataset.target\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      MedInc\n      HouseAge\n      AveRooms\n      AveBedrms\n      Population\n      AveOccup\n      Latitude\n      Longitude\n      Price\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      8.3252\n      41.0\n      6.984127\n      1.023810\n      322.0\n      2.555556\n      37.88\n      -122.23\n      4.526\n    \n    \n      1\n      8.3014\n      21.0\n      6.238137\n      0.971880\n      2401.0\n      2.109842\n      37.86\n      -122.22\n      3.585\n    \n    \n      2\n      7.2574\n      52.0\n      8.288136\n      1.073446\n      496.0\n      2.802260\n      37.85\n      -122.24\n      3.521\n    \n    \n      3\n      5.6431\n      52.0\n      5.817352\n      1.073059\n      558.0\n      2.547945\n      37.85\n      -122.25\n      3.413\n    \n    \n      4\n      3.8462\n      52.0\n      6.281853\n      1.081081\n      565.0\n      2.181467\n      37.85\n      -122.25\n      3.422\n    \n  \n\n\nHere we separate into training and testing in a (pseudo) random way to finally evaluate performance.\nxtrain, xtest, ytrain, ytest =\\\n    train_test_split(df.drop('Price', axis=1), df.Price, test_size=.3,\n                     random_state=42)\nxtrain.head()\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      MedInc\n      HouseAge\n      AveRooms\n      AveBedrms\n      Population\n      AveOccup\n      Latitude\n      Longitude\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      7061\n      4.1312\n      35.0\n      5.882353\n      0.975490\n      1218.0\n      2.985294\n      33.93\n      -118.02\n    \n    \n      14689\n      2.8631\n      20.0\n      4.401210\n      1.076613\n      999.0\n      2.014113\n      32.79\n      -117.09\n    \n    \n      17323\n      4.2026\n      24.0\n      5.617544\n      0.989474\n      731.0\n      2.564912\n      34.59\n      -120.14\n    \n    \n      10056\n      3.1094\n      14.0\n      5.869565\n      1.094203\n      302.0\n      2.188406\n      39.26\n      -121.00\n    \n    \n      15750\n      3.3068\n      52.0\n      4.801205\n      1.066265\n      1526.0\n      2.298193\n      37.77\n      -122.45\n    \n  \n\n\nWe now load cross-validation specifically into KFold so that we don't \"lose\" a lot of data, and the templates that will be used , here there is no rule of thumb about the base models, it is up to you, but for the meta-estimator is usually applied boosting trees. Here I arbitrarily chose kNN and ElasticNet, but as a meta-estimator I will use xgboost.\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import ElasticNet\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import KFold\n\nfrom xgboost import XGBRFRegressor\n\nen = ElasticNet()\nknn = KNeighborsRegressor()\n# we will early stop to not overfit\ngbm = XGBRFRegressor(n_jobs=-1, objective='reg:squarederror')\n\nNow the creation of the stacked attributes begins, to make sure that there are no biases and we don't have little data to train the meta-estimator we create them by kfolds, being generated the training and test subsets, we train the model in the training set and we predict the value for the test set as follows:\nkf = KFold(20, shuffle=True)\nxtrain['en'] = 0\nfor train_index, test_index in kf.split(xtrain):\n    en.fit(xtrain.iloc[train_index, :-1], ytrain.iloc[train_index])\n    xtrain.iloc[test_index,8] = en.predict(xtrain.iloc[test_index, :-1])\n\nWe do the same for the other model.\nkf = KFold(20, shuffle=True)\nxtrain['knn'] = 0\n\nfor train_index, test_index in kf.split(xtrain):\n    knn.fit(xtrain.iloc[train_index, :-2], ytrain.iloc[train_index])\n

stacked features 0.5828429815199971\nWith stacked features 0.5359477372727965\n\nWe've had a significant improvement using \"stacked\" attributes, concluding our meta estimator learns the best way to combine the features of other estimators, learning their generalization errors and how to correct them, ensuring a much better generalization.\nReferences\nStacked
