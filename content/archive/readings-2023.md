Okay, so I am reviving this blog to post reviews about my readings
for this year. I pretend to focus my readings in economy, philosophy,
    and sci-fi. Let's go.

# Economy in One Lesson
by Henry Hazlitt

This book is still up-to-date with recent problems we face. Henry follows
a supply demand approach in his analysis of many economical issues. It
spend most of it's pages defending that everything in a economy is an
asset, and things like money, or wages does not escape from being subject
to economical forces and its implications. The book claims that minimum wage,
price fixing, and other kind of legislation as does not create any more value,
has no benefitial outcome for the overall society. I firmly recommend this
book for anyone.

# The Hobbit
by J.R.R. Tolkien

This is certanly one of the times that I want to erase my memory so I could
truly appreciate something. This book is surely a master piece, but reading
it already knowing what will happen totally cuts the hype. The book is
substatialy better then the film, there are many psychological and
environmental aspects that lack in the film. It was a pity to have a couldn't
enjoy as a first experience.
