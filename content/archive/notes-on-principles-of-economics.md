# Introduction

# Supply, Demand, and Equilibrium

# Taxes and Subsidies

# The Price System
## Concepts
    - Invisible Hand: The non planned cordination that happens naturally between production
    and consumption in a market economy.

- Signals and Incentives.

- Prices do not only reflect only willingness to earn, but also, willingness to pay,
    costs of production and many more other factor of production.
- Prices are vital for a market economy and it's flux of information and allocation of
    resources.

# Price Ceilings and Price Floors
## Concepts
    - Shortages:
    - Misallocation of Resources:
    - Deadweight Loss:
    - Quality Reduction:
    - Search Costs

- Against the common sense, price floors (and wage) floors, do not benefit the society, but only the
  ones the had the "luck" to acquire the price setted. When price controls happens it imbalance the
  forces of supply and demand, generating a negative output.

# Trade

# Externalities

# Costs and Profit Maximization Under Profit

# Competition and the Invisible Hand

# Monopoly

# Price Discrimination
## Concepts
    - Tying:
    - Bundling: When a company sells products in a package (like Microsoft Office), this approach
    leads consumer to increase consumption by attaching no high demanded products, but the overall
    surplus of the combination of products lead consumer to acquire all products. This approach
    maximize the company profit.

# Labor Markets
## Concepts
    - Human Capital:
    - Signaling:
    - Compensating Differentials: the surplus in wages or beneffits that should be given to the worker
        to make the job offer more appealing in a competitive market labor.
    - Marginal Product of Labor: The amount of revenue add to the company by adding more human
      capital.

- Jobs with high risk, boring, etc. has a lower demand from workers, so they should compensate in
  money to attract workers.

# Public Goods and the Tragedy of the Commons

# Asymmetric Information

# Consumer Choice

# Game Theory
